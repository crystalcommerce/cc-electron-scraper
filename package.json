  "description": "A desktop application built with electron-js (powered by nodejs and chromuim browser) that will be mainly used for web-scraping. This application will allow script injection at a modular level. This approach will reduce the memory usage of the chromuim browser instance as there will be a separate process for the main process of the application and the instances of the browser windows that this application will create.",
